# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python Learning repository! ðŸš€  

This repository is a personal space where I document my journey of learning Python, one of the most versatile and powerful programming languages. Starting from **December 14, 2024**, Iâ€™ll be tracking everything I learn and create in Python.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Code Snippets**: Examples of Python concepts and solutions to coding problems.
- **Projects**: Mini-projects to practice and apply what Iâ€™ve learned.
- **Notes**: Summaries of new concepts, libraries, or techniques I discover.
- **Experiments**: Fun experiments and explorations in Python.

## Why This Repository?
1. **Learning in Public**: Sharing my progress keeps me motivated and helps others learn from my journey.
2. **Practice Makes Perfect**: Regular practice is the best way to build skills in Python.
3. **Portfolio Building**: Over time, this repository will become a showcase of my Python skills.

## How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore the code, learn from my notes, or even contribute if you'd like!  

### Structure
- `code_snippets/`: Short programs and concept demos.
- `projects/`: Complete or ongoing projects.
