#A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

#Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

#To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

#Or you can use triple quotes:

"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
